# 🎬 IMDB Movie Data Analysis (SQL Project) : In Progress

This project is a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of the IMDB movie dataset. It explores movie trends, genres, directors, production houses, and actors based on various metrics like ratings, duration, and votes.

The analysis addresses **29 SQL questions**, each solved using **three different methods**:
- Standard SQL (SELECT-FROM-WHERE)
- SQL with JOINS
- SQL with Subqueries/CTEs

The project was developed as part of an academic assignment at **CDAC Mumbai** by **Team 9 – Code Alchemist** under the **Diploma in Big Data Analytics (DBDA)** program.
