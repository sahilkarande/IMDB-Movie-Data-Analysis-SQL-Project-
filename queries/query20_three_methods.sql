-- Q20. Who are the top two actors whose movies have a median rating >= 8?
-- Type your code below:


# Method 1
SELECT 
    n.name,                      -- Actor/actress name
    COUNT(r.movie_id) AS movie_count  -- Count of movies they've appeared in
FROM names n                     -- Names table (actors/actresses)
JOIN role_mapping rm ON n.id = rm.name_id  -- Join to role mapping
JOIN ratings r ON rm.movie_id = r.movie_id  -- Join to ratings
GROUP BY n.name                  -- Group results by actor name
HAVING AVG(r.avg_rating) >= 8    -- Filter for actors with average movie rating >= 8
ORDER BY movie_count DESC        -- Sort by movie count (highest first)
LIMIT 2;                        -- Return only top 2 results

# Method 2
SELECT 
    actor_name,                  -- Actor/actress name
    movie_count                  -- Count of qualifying movies
FROM (
    -- Subquery calculates metrics for each actor
    SELECT 
        n.name AS actor_name,    -- Actor name
        COUNT(r.movie_id) AS movie_count,  -- Movie count
        AVG(r.avg_rating) AS avg_rating  -- Average rating across their movies
    FROM names n
    JOIN role_mapping rm ON n.id = rm.name_id
    JOIN ratings r ON rm.movie_id = r.movie_id
    GROUP BY n.name              -- Group by actor
) AS actor_stats                -- Name the subquery result set
WHERE avg_rating >= 8           -- Filter for high average ratings
ORDER BY movie_count DESC       -- Sort by movie count
LIMIT 2;                       -- Return top 2

# Method 3
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE top_actors()
BEGIN
    -- Same logic as Method 1 but encapsulated in a procedure
    SELECT 
        n.name AS actor_name,    -- Actor name
        COUNT(r.movie_id) AS movie_count  -- Movie count
    FROM names n
    JOIN role_mapping rm ON n.id = rm.name_id
    JOIN ratings r ON rm.movie_id = r.movie_id
    GROUP BY n.name
    HAVING AVG(r.avg_rating) >= 8  -- High average rating filter
    ORDER BY movie_count DESC     -- Sort by productivity
    LIMIT 2;                     -- Return top 2
END $$
DELIMITER ;

-- Execute the procedure to get results
CALL top_actors();
