-- Q5. Find the unique list of the genres present in the data set?
-- Type your code below:


# Methode 1
SELECT DISTINCT genre  -- first select the column that you want find unique things we used function distnict keyword and not repeated genres 
FROM genre; -- and then from which table mention table name it will give the unique things

-- # Methode 2
SELECT genre -- select the genre column from the genre table
FROM genre -- group rows by genre so that each genre appears only once
GROUP BY genre;

-- # Method 3
-- create a temporary table called "ranked_genres"
-- in this step, we are giving a number to each genre (like 1st, 2nd, 3rd...) 
-- based on the order of movie_id for that genre

WITH genre_check AS(
SELECT genre , RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY genre ORDER BY movie_id) AS rank_id
FROM genre
)
-- select only the rows where the rank is 1
-- this gives one row for each genre (the first one based on movie_id)
SELECT genre FROM genre_check WHERE rank_id=1;


/* So, RSVP Movies plans to make a movie of one of these genres.
Now, wouldnâ€™t you want to know which genre had the highest number of movies produced in the last year?
Combining both the movie and genres table can give more interesting insights. */
