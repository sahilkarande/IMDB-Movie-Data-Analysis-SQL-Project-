-- Q23.Find out the top five actresses in Hindi movies released in India based on their average ratings? 
-- Note: The actresses should have acted in at least three Indian movies. 
-- (Hint: You should use the weighted average based on votes. If the ratings clash, then the total number of votes should act as the tie breaker.)
